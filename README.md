# SearchCD
Forgot that directory name? Simply search, select, and automatically cd.

### Installation:
  1. ```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/projectname.git```
  2.  ```cd projectname```
  3. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
  4. ```python3 Scripts/setup.py``` ## this makes the program run on bootup, and immediately after execution
  check for explosions
  
### 2. Notes:
  hotkey for searching is currently ctrl+g
  reduce max_workers to chew less RAM
  File tree & trie construction takes a bit of time. Search operations may fail if you search quickly after executing setup.py

### 3. Iminent Changes:
  Mac functionality
  search by files

I'd really love your feedback/suggestions! This is my first public project and I'd like to make many more. Email: garrettmoore@berkeley.edu
