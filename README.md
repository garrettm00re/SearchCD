# SearchCD
Forgot that directory name? Simply search, select, and automatically cd.

## Getting Started:
  pull
  ```pip install requirements.txt```
  ```python3 Scripts/setup.py``` ## this makes the program run on bootup, and immediately after execution
  check for explosions
  
## Notes:
  hotkey for searching is currently ctrl+g
  reduce max_workers to chew less RAM
  File tree & trie construction takes a bit of time. Search operations may fail if you search quickly after executing setup.py

## Iminent Changes:
  Mac functionality
  search by files

I'd really love your feedback/suggestions! This is my first public project and I'd like to make many more. Email: garrettmoore@berkeley.edu
