# SearchCD
Forgot that directory name? Simply search, select, and automatically cd.

### Installation:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/garrettm00re/searchCD.git
   ```
   ```
   cd searchCD
   ```
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   ```
   python3 Scripts/setup.py # makes program run on bootup
   ```
  check for explosions
  
### Notes:
  - hotkey for searching is currently ctrl+g
  - reduce max_workers to chew less RAM
  - File tree & trie construction takes a bit of time. Search operations may fail if you search quickly after executing setup.py

### Iminent Changes:
  - Mac functionality
  - search by files

### I'd really love your feedback/suggestions, especially as this is my first public project.
