# SearchCD
Forgot that directory name? Simply search, select, and automatically cd.

### 1. Getting Started:
  ```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/projectname.git
    cd projectname
  ```
  ```pip install requirements.txt```
  ```python3 Scripts/setup.py``` ## this makes the program run on bootup, and immediately after execution
  check for explosions
  
### 2. Notes:
  hotkey for searching is currently ctrl+g
  reduce max_workers to chew less RAM
  File tree & trie construction takes a bit of time. Search operations may fail if you search quickly after executing setup.py

### 3. Iminent Changes:
  Mac functionality
  search by files

I'd really love your feedback/suggestions! This is my first public project and I'd like to make many more. Email: garrettmoore@berkeley.edu
